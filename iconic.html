    <h6>Jaguar XK120 (1948-1954)</h6>

    <P>The XK120 was the first entirely new car produced by Jaguar after the World War II. It was announced at the British Motor Show in October 1948 and was only the second sports car ever made by the company. It was the first car to feature Jaguar's own in-house designed engine, the famous XK straight six power unit. The models that were available in the XK120 range were the XK120 open two seater (roadster),XK120 fixed-head coupe and the XK120 drophead coupe. The two seater (roadster) was aimed at the true sports car market, offering minimal accomodation and equipment levels with high performance and good handling. The fixed head coupe was a true grand tourer in its own right. It still offered the performance and handling capabilities of the roadster. It was structurally very well robust and featured lockable doors, wind-up windows and even a walnut veneered dashboard. The drophead coupe provided a mix of both the other XK120 models. It had open head driving experience, the roof could be taken down and put back up whenever by slightly releasing the windscreen and then folding it down. It also contained the comfort and wind-up windows and lockable doors.</P>

    <h6>Jaguar E-Type (1961-1974)</h6>
    <section class="col_detail">
    <img src="Images/Jaguar%20Etype.jpg" style="width: 500", height="300">
    <p>Jaguar had developed a well established sports car market since 1948 with its XK range or cars. The design for a new sports car changed with Jaguar's successes at Le Mans which was won by the Jaguar D-type in 1955 and 1957. It was the D-type that helped Jaguar and its aurodynamicist Malcom Sayer to design the E-type. Launched in 1961 at the Geneva Motor Show, the E-type became the most talked about car of the decade. It wasnt until 1964 that any major changes were made to the overall design. In 1966 a new addition came into the range offering an extra two rear seats on a longer wheelbase bodyshell and also for the first time in an E-Type, an automatic transmission. Then in 1968 came a new E-type, known as the Series 2 and inclueded three models, roadster, coupe and 2+2 and continued in production until 1971. In 1971 the new Series 3 appeared and was the first to show Jaguar's new 12 cylinder engine in a wider bodyshell and also included new improved brakes,steering and styling features. However the Series 3 only stayed in production until 1974. Since then the E-Type has remained the epitome of the finest in Jaguar sport car design, a design even current sports car producers refer back to - an icon of the 60's and of Jaguar sports car design forever.</p>
        
    <h6>Jaguar XJ-S (1975-1996)</h6>
    <section class="col_detail">
    <img src="Images/Jaguar%20XJS.jpg" style="width: 500", height="300">
    <p>The Jaguar XJ-S was a luxury grand tourer car manufactured and marketed from 1975 to 1996, in coupé, fixed-profile and full convertible bodystyles. Originally developed using the platform of the then current William Heynes designed XJ saloon, the XJ-S was noted for its prominent rear flying buttresses. The early styling was partially by Jaguar's aerodynamicist Malcolm Sayer — one of the first designers to apply advanced aero principles to cars. Sayer died just before the XJ-S body styling was frozen for production. From July 1981, the XJ-S was renamed the XJ-S HE and received the new High-Efficiency V12 engine for much better fuel economy. With the Fire Ball combustion chamber designed by Swiss Engineer Michael May, power output was increased as a by-product to 220 kW (295 hp) or 196 kW (263 hp) in North America. At the same time, the XJ-S HE received changes to its exterior and interior with body-coloured boot trim in place of the standard previous black, new five-spoke (starfish) alloy wheels, chrome inserts on the upper part of the bumpers, burled elm inserts on dashboard and door cappings. In its final production from 1991 to 1996, Jaguar was acquired by Ford, who introduced numerous modifications — and eliminated the hyphen in the name, marketing Jaguar's longest running model simply as the XJS.</p>
        
        
    <h6>Jaguar XJ220 (1992-1994) </h6>
    <section class="col_detail">
    <img src="Images/Jaguar%20XJ220.jpg"style="width: 500", height="300" >
    <p>The Jaguar XJ220 is a two-seat sports car produced by British luxury car manufacturer Jaguar from 1992 until 1994. The XJ220 recorded a top speed of 212.3 mph (341.7 km/h) during testing by Jaguar at the Nardo test track in Italy. This made it the fastest production car from 1992 to 1993. According to Jaguar, an XJ220 prototype managed a Nürburgring lap time of 7:46.36 in 1991 which was faster than any production car lap time before it. The XJ220 was developed from a V12-engined 4-wheel drive concept car designed by an informal group of Jaguar employees working in their spare time. The group wished to create a modern version of the successful Jaguar 24 Hours of Le Mans racing cars of the 1950s and 1960s that could be entered into FIA Group B competitions. The initial XJ220 concept car was unveiled to the public at the 1988 British International Motor Show, held in Birmingham, England. Its positive reception prompted Jaguar to put the car into production. Engineering and emissions requirements resulted in significant changes to the specification of the XJ220, most notably the replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine by a turbocharged V6 engine. The changes to the specification and a collapse in the demand of high performance cars brought about by the early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992, making it one of the most expensive cars at that time</p>
        
    <h6>Jaguar F-Type (2013 to date) </h6>
    <section class="col_detail">
    <img src="Images/2014_jaguar_f_type-3.jpg"style="width: 500", height="300" >
    <P>In 2013 Jaguar produced its first two seater sports car since the E-Type in 1974. It is the replacement for the XK grand tourer and so-called "spiritual successor" to the famous E-Type. The F-type was introduced with new supercharged Jaguar petrol enginbes of 3.0 litre and 5.0 litre capicity, with the lastest stop-start technology and an active exhaust system to enhance the car's sound. All F-types are convertible and available in 3 models, the F-type with 340 bhp 3.0 litre V6 engine, F-type S with 380bhp version of the same engine and the F-type V8 S with a developed version of Jaguar's 5.0 litre V8 engine. The 3 versions of the F-type offer progressively more powerful braking systems, all with the high levels of pedal feedback required for accurate modulation. The car won Car of The Year at the 2013 Middle East Motor Awards.The Jaguar F-Type 400 Sport, a special-edition model that would remain on sale for just one year, was launched as part of a raft of revisions to the British sports car. The F-Type 400 Sport launch edition is powered by an upgraded version of the 3.0-litre supercharged V6 engine producing a power output of 395 hp.</P>
