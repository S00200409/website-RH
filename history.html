            <h4>Pre-war SS Jaguars 1935 to 1940</h4>
            
            <p2><img src="Images/Jaguar%20SS100.jpg" style="width: 500", height="300">The launch of the Jaguar name came about in September 1935 with the annoucement of a new saloon model from SS Cars Limited. Only two models were launched at the Mayfair Hotel in London prior to the 1935 British Motor Show, the 2.5 litre straight six saloon and a 1.5 litre four cylinder version. In 1937 the 'new' SS Jaguar models were upgraded and had an improved overall design which included the 1.5 and 2.5 litre drophead coupe. These models were built using ash wood framework and was very time-comsuming and proved to slow to meet the heavy sales demand for the cars. Hence, in 1938 the production switched to steel bodies for the SS Jaguar saloons and this meant a few more changes to the design again. The drophead coupes remained hand built in the traditional manner. With the introduction of the steel bodied cars, SS launched another new variant to the range, a larger 3.5 litre version and the SS100 was fitted with the bigger engine also. The 1.5 litre was enlarged to a 1.75 litre engine in late 1937. Production continued towards the start of the Second World War, with some changes taking effect in 1939 and early 1940. The 1.74 litre and 3.5 litre saloons being the last to roll off the production lines (July and December 1940 respectfully).</p2>
            
            <h4>Post-war Jaguar 1945 to 1951</h4>
            
            <p2><img src="Images/Jaguar%20MK%20V.jpg" style="width: 500", height="300">The Jaguar Mark V was a luxury automobile built from 1945 to 1951. It was available as a four-door Saloon (sedan) and a two-door convertible known as the Drop Head Coup√©, both versions seating five adults. It was the first Jaguar with independent front suspension, with hydraulic brakes, with spats (fender skirts), first specifically designed to be produced in both Right and Left Hand Drive configurations, first with disc centre wheels, with smaller wider 16" balloon tyres, first to be offered with sealed headlamps and flashing turn signals for the important American market, and the last model to use the pushrod engines. The Mark V was introduced to distributors and the press on 30 September 1948 and launched on 27 October 1948 at the London Motor Show at the same time as the announcement of the XK120, with which it shared a stand. The XK120, though not quite ready for production, was the star of the show. However, the Mark V vastly outsold the XK120 by roughly 5,000 cars per year as compared to 2,000 cars per year for the XK120. Three cars were built in late 1948 and saloon production was well under way by March 1949, though the DHC was delayed for some months, and the last cars were built in mid 1951.
