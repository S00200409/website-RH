            <h3>Jaguar heritage</h3>
            
            <p>The beginning years of Jaguar can be traced back to Blackpool, under the title 0f the Swallow Sidecar Company. In 1922 a partnership was formed between one William Lyons and William Walmsley and they initially produced sidecars for the mototrcycle trade. Within 4 years the business moved to larger premises, where stylish bodies bodies were produced for contemporary cars like the Austin Seven. Swallow produced its first complete cars, the SS1 and SS2 models in 1931 but 3 years later in 1934 the partnership between Lyons and Walmsley broke up and William Lyons took full control of the businesses.</p>
